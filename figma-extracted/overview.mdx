## Upsell Badge vs Feature Highlight Tag

### Difference

**Feature Highlight tag** to be displayed on a new feature or module - which may require activation or not - for a given period of time.

**Upsell Badge**: to be displayed on a module as long as it is not activated.

### Example

Taking the example of expense reports, which is a feature to activate:

Day 0 to Day X*: display the **Feature Highlight tag** and upon clicking the menu, we show the landing page.

From Day X + 1: we display the **Upsell Badge** until activation of the feature.

X depends on the end date defined in the component.
