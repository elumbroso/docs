# Figma Sync Example

This file demonstrates how to use the Figma sync workflow. Follow the pattern below for your own components.

## Step 1: Add the Figma Frame Comment

After your frontmatter, add this comment with your Figma file ID and node ID:

```mdx
<!-- figma-frame: FILE_ID/NODE_ID -->
```

Replace:
- `FILE_ID` with your Figma file ID
- `NODE_ID` with your Figma node/frame ID

## Step 2: Write Your Component Documentation

Add your normal documentation content below the comment. The sync workflow won't interfere with it.

```mdx
## Overview

Describe what your component does...

## Usage

Show how to use the component...

## Variants

List available variants...
```

## Step 3: Let the Sync Add Specifications

The workflow will automatically:
1. Add a `<!-- figma-screenshot -->` marker
2. Export a 2x PNG screenshot to `figma-screenshots/`
3. Extract and insert design specifications
4. Create a pull request with all changes

## Example with Placeholder IDs

Here's what a complete component documentation looks like:

```markdown
---
title: Button Component
description: Primary action button
---

<!-- figma-frame: h8Ugks6YufraLCbPxOkgxb/1-11 -->

## Overview

The Button component is a reusable interactive element for triggering actions.

## When to Use

- Trigger primary actions
- Submit forms
- Navigate to pages

## Variants

- Primary (default)
- Secondary
- Disabled

## Implementation

Use this component throughout your app for consistent styling.

<!-- figma-specs-end -->
```

## Tips

### Finding Your FILE_ID and NODE_ID

1. **FILE_ID**: In your Figma file URL
   ```
   https://www.figma.com/file/[FILE_ID]/FileName
                           ^^^^^^^^
   ```

2. **NODE_ID**: Select a frame/component, then look at URL
   ```
   https://www.figma.com/file/FILE_ID/FileName?node-id=[NODE_ID]
                                                       ^^^^^^^
   ```

### Multiple Frames per File

You can track multiple Figma frames in one `.mdx` file:

```mdx
---
title: Form Components
---

## Text Input

<!-- figma-frame: FILE_ID/NODE_ID_1 -->

Text input documentation...

## Checkbox

<!-- figma-frame: FILE_ID/NODE_ID_2 -->

Checkbox documentation...
```

### Screenshot Organization

Screenshots are automatically saved to:
```
components/figma-screenshots/NODE_ID-@2x.png
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
           (relative to the .mdx file location)
```

## What Gets Synced

✅ **Screenshots**
- Exported at 2x scale (retina quality)
- Saved as PNG files

✅ **Specifications**
- Frame dimensions (width, height)
- Fill colors (with opacity)
- Stroke colors (with opacity)
- Typography (font, size, weight, line height)

✅ **Comments**
- Automatically placed in your .mdx file
- Marked with special comment blocks
- Safe to edit around

## Workflow Status

Check the status of your sync:

1. Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub
2. Look for "Sync Figma Screenshots and Specs"
3. Click on latest run to see logs
4. Check for pull requests titled "chore: sync Figma updates"

## Scheduling

- **Default**: Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- **Manual**: Anytime from Actions → Run workflow
- **Edit schedule**: Modify `.github/workflows/sync-figma.yml`

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow won't start
- Ensure `FIGMA_API_TOKEN` is added to GitHub Secrets
- Check token has "File read" scope

### Frames not detected
- Verify comment format: `<!-- figma-frame: FILE_ID/NODE_ID -->`
- Check that FILE_ID and NODE_ID are correct
- Verify file/node still exists in Figma

### Specifications not extracted
- Some properties may not be available in Figma API
- Complex nested components may extract partial specs
- Review the PR for what was extracted

## Next Steps

1. Add this pattern to your `.mdx` files
2. Replace FILE_ID and NODE_ID with your Figma details
3. Run the workflow from Actions tab
4. Review the generated PR
5. Merge to publish your synced documentation
